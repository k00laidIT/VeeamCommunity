# VeeamCommunity

## Purpose

This project will (hopefully) serve as the home of a set of modern, easily installable Powershell Modules for the entire [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com) suite of products. Today at best Veeam products require their fat console application to be installed to use the powershell modules, if there is powershell support at all. These modules will be fully Rest API driven, removing the need for software installation or dlls to be accessed.

We will be publishing early and hopefully often so if you encounter bugs with either the modules or the API responses please be sure to submit a bug report in the [github repository](https://github.com/k00laidIT/VeeamCommunity/issues).

Contributors to start will be [Jim Jones](https://github.com/k00laidIT) and [Joe Houghes](https://github.com/jhoughes). If you run into issues please use the bug tracking facilities within github.


## Usage
Coming soon(ish)


## Desired Milestones

1. Project Kickoff (May 4, 2023)
2. Gather Swagger documents for Veeam 2023 releases
3. Attempt to use [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) against swagger documents
4. Render Powershell cmdlets for each swagger document into a separate sub-module
5. Make modules available via Github
6. Work with collaborators to add descriptions and build out the help content
